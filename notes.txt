When code is pushed to a GitHub repository, it typically follows a **three-stage architecture** involving:

---

### **1. Working Directory (Working Tree)**

This is where you write and modify your code files. It represents the current state of your project on your local machine.

* **Actions:**

  * Editing files
  * Creating new files
  * Deleting files

---

### **2. Staging Area (Index)**

This is a preparation area where you tell Git which changes you want to include in the next commit. You use this area to selectively choose what to commit.

* **Command:**

  ```bash
  git add <file>
  ```
* **Purpose:**

  * Allows staging specific changes.
  * Lets you preview what will go into the commit.

---

### **3. Local Repository**

This is where committed changes are stored in your local Git repository. It maintains the complete history of your project.

* **Command:**

  ```bash
  git commit -m "Your message"
  ```
* **Purpose:**

  * Stores the snapshot of the project.
  * Ready to be shared with others.

---

### **Final Step: Push to Remote Repository (GitHub)**

Once your changes are committed locally, you push them to GitHub (the **remote repository**).

* **Command:**

  ```bash
  git push origin <branch>
  ```
* **Effect:**

  * Uploads your local commits to the GitHub repository.
  * Updates the remote with your latest work.

### **Summary Table**

| Stage                | Area             | Command      | Description               |
| -------------------- | ---------------- | ------------ | ------------------------- |
| 1. Working Directory | Local Filesystem | Edit files   | Where you make changes    |
| 2. Staging Area      | Local Git        | `git add`    | Prepares files for commit |
| 3. Local Repository  | Local Git        | `git commit` | Saves snapshot            |
| Final Step           | GitHub (Remote)  | `git push`   | Sends commits to GitHub   |
